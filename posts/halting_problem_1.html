<p>undecidability</p>

<!-- intro paragraph -->
<section>That halting problem is very well known in the field of computer science; it states that no computer program can exist that can determine whether or not any program will terminate. Its proof has massive implications for philosophy, mathematics, and computer science because it describes some of the limits of computation. If we know that a function isn't computable by a Turing machine, then we wouldn't waste our time trying to solve the problem as we would have proven that a general solution doesn't exist. It might seem daunting to prove that no machine can undertake this task; you might get the impression that we would have to analyze every possible Turing machine, but thankfully we have a useful trick to help us. We will be using some informal definitions and some simple Python code to demonstrate the undecidability of the halting problem.</section>

<!-- decidability definition -->
<section><b>Decidability</b> - A <b>Turing machine</b> is decidable if every input to the Turing machine yields one of two possible outputs.</section>

<!-- halting vs non-halting code -->
<section>Just as the Turing machine can halt, it can also fail to halt. Failing to halt does not necessarily mean the program has entered into an infinite loop; some program and input combinations just take an incredibly long time to execute (e.g. brute forcing a 256-bit key). The logic of most programs can be determined pretty easily, take this Python code for example:</section>

<code>
<p>def halt():</p>
<p class="indent-1">print('Halting.')</p>
<br/>
<p>halt()</p>
</code>

<section>This code clearly prints a message and finishes execution, halting the program. This is distinct from sections of code that loop indefinitely like the following:</section>

<code>
<p>def loop():</p>
<p class="indent-1">while True: continue</p>
<br/>
<p>loop()</p>
</code>

<!-- proof outline -->
<section>This code will clearly never terminate on its own, and therefore does not halt. It seems easy enough to determine whether a simple piece of code will halt or not. If the halting problem was decidable, we would be able to do this for any arbitrary program and input. This is an incredibly strong statement because it entails that a single counterexample is sufficient for proving the undecidability of the halting problem. How do we go about this proof? The most straightforward way, used by Turing and others, is a <b>proof by contradiction</b>.</section>

<section>This proof technique might be foreign to you, but it's widely used in philosophy, mathematics, and computer science to prove numerous results. The general structure of the argument is:</section>
<section><b>1.</b> Assume that the <b>negation</b> of what we want to prove is true</section>
<section><b>2.</b> Use this assumption to infer a contradiction</section>
<section><b>3.</b> Use the contradiction to reject our assumption</section>

<!-- informal proof of undecidability of hp -->
<section>We begin with our assumption that the halting problem is decidable.</section>
<section><b>Assumption:</b> The halting problem is decidable.</section>

<section>If the halting problem is decidable, then there exists a decider Turing machine that carries out the algorithm for all possible inputs. Let's refer to this decider algorithm for the halting problem as the <b>halting oracle H</b>. The internals of this halting oracle can't be described, since it in fact can't exist, but we are still assuming our function works as it should for every possible input. It makes sense then to consider this halting oracle as a black box that takes in a program and returns 'True' if the program halts, and 'False' otherwise.

<section>Let's also describe the halting algorithm with a simple Python function. This function will behave the exact same way as the halting oracle H above. Imagine we have something like the following:</section>

<code>
<p>def H(x, x):</p>
<p class="indent-1">''' Return True if x halts on input x, False if x does not halt on x'''</p>
<br/>
<p>H(x, x)</p>
</code>

<section>Imagine that this function will work for any possible program passed to it, and that it will correctly determine whether or not the program will halt. To show that this algorithm can't exist, we need to build a <b>contrarian algorithm C</b>, that responds to the output of our halting oracle and does the exact opposite.</section> 

<!-- contrarian program diagram and code-->
<div class="img-wrapper">
	<img src="images/post_1/contrarian.png"/>
</div>

<section>As you can see, this machine C is constructed from H. We can define it formally as follows:</section>

<section><b>C(x) = &not;H(x, x)</b></section>

<section>This typically wouldn't be an issue, but we are able to hack the contrarian machine into a contradiction, by passing the machine C as an input into itself.</section>

<section>So we run the machine C and pass in C as its input. Since our halting oracle is a decider, it will either return True if C halts, and return False if C doesn't halt. However, since we constructed C such that it negates the output of our halting oracle H, the halting oracle will always incorrectly predict whether or not C halts.</section>

<section>There are two possible cases for the machine C running on input C:</section>

<section><b>Case 1:</b> H predicts C(C) halts</section>

<section>This means that C(C) and H(C, C) should both be True</section>

<section>C(C) = &not;H(C, C)</section>

<section>True = &not;True</section>

<section>True = False</section>

<section>We have reached a contradiction in this case.</section>

<section><b>Case 2:</b> H predicts C(C) doesn't halt</section>

<section>This means that C(C) and H(C, C) should both be False</section>

<section>C(C) = &not;H(C, C)</section>

<section>False = &not;False</section>

<section>False = True</section>

<section>We have reached a contradiction in this case as well.</section>

<section>If we visualize it in code, we can see the contradiction more explicitly.</section>

<code>
<p>def C(C):</p>
<p class="indent-1">if H(C, C):</p>
<p class="indent-2">while True: continue</p>
<p class="indent-1">print("Halting")</p>
<br/>
<p>C(C)</p>
</code>

<!-- rejecting the assumption/proving undecidability of hp -->
<section>If our halting oracle H determines that our contrarian function C will halt, the contrarian function begins executing an infinite loop, thus not halting. If the halting function returns false, the contrarian function will print a statement and terminate, halting the program. So if C is determined to halt, then it doesn't halt, and if it's determined not to halt, then it halts. Doesn't seem very sound, does it? This program can't be both true and false on the same input, so in order to avoid dealing with the contradiction, we infer that our initial assumption about the halting problem must've been wrong. The reasonable solution is to deny this assumption and conclude that the halting problem is undecidable. To summarize this informal proof, our logic looks roughly like this:</section>

<section>If the halting problem is decidable, then we can build an algorithm that will correctly predict whether any program will halt or not. Since we have shown that we cannot build such an algorithm (because the contrarian program is an exception to this), then we have to conclude that the halting problem must be undecidable.</section>
